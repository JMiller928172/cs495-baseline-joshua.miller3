I decided not to complete the tasks in step 3, option 2 for this assignment.

The most overwhelming part of this class to me is all the different roles, between project owner, business analyst, scrum masters, and all the other roles. In previous projects I've worked on, whether at internships or in class, typically I take the team, we figure out project objectives, and then I split us into teams and we divide and conquer. 

In this environment, there is so much technical and non-technical communication to go along with all the different roles everyone has to take on. I am overwhelmed and worried that with all these roles between a group of 4-5 our project will be subpar and my team and I will be unable to meet all the needs of the client.

I plan to build confidence by learning as much as I can about these roles both through this class and through talking with my father who has been in most of the roles we covered in class.
