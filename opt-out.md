I decided not to complete the tasks in step 3, option 2 for this assignment.

While I'm sure I could figure out option 2, with more time, it has been a long few days and long weekend with my responsabilites between ROTC and RA duties. While it is not unmanageable, I am still figuring out a proper work balance. My schedule is overwhelming me with tasks, and to keep myself from spreading myself too thin, I chose to opt-out from option 2.  

I plan to fix this by figuring out my schedule more and giving myself at least 5 hours of sleep each night!
